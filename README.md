## Using the discipline of TDD, build a game of tic tac toe:
- Requirements are outlined here: https://learn.madetech.com/sparring/tic-tac-toe/
- The game should allow a human to play against an unbeatable AI. 
- The game can be made with a UI.

**Rules**
- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Player 1 is X and player 2 is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
- The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row is the winner.
- If all 9 squares are full and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game is over with a tie.
